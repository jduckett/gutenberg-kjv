# purpose

The purpose of this project is to parse the ASCII text file found at: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10.txt.utf-8
and break it into smaller more useable chunks and formats for developers of bible software or whatever...

I'm a retired programmer and this is just a quick project that I thought someone might find useful if they have a desire to develop a project based on the kjv text found at gutenberg.org

# environment

My development environment is linux. I'm not and never was a python developer. I simply chose python cuz I thought it would be quick and common to most developers.  you may have to tweak the main script to get it to run. I did my best to stick to standard python libraries.

I am running python3 and I made the script executable (i think).

#!/usr/bin/env python3


# run the main script

./build.py

Hope this helps someone.
